# Diffview Step-by-Step Guide

Complete guide to mastering Diffview for code review, branch comparison, and merge conflicts.

---

## Step 1: Understanding Diffview's Purpose

Diffview shows you **side-by-side diffs** - much better than line-by-line diffs.

**Three main use cases:**
1. **Review your changes** before committing
2. **Compare branches** (yours vs main)
3. **Resolve merge conflicts** (the killer feature)

---

## Step 2: Open Diffview (Basic Usage)

Let's start simple:

| Command | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| `<Space>dd` | Diff current changes (like `git diff`) |
| `:DiffviewOpen` | Same as above |
| `:DiffviewClose` | Close Diffview |

**Exercise:**
1. Make a change to any file
2. Press `<Space>dd`
3. You'll see **two panels:**
   - Left = **OLD** version (before changes)
   - Right = **NEW** version (with changes)

**Navigation:**
- Changes are highlighted in red (removed) and green (added)
- Your cursor works in both panels
- Use `j` / `k` to scroll

---

## Step 3: The Diffview Layout (Understanding What You See)

When you open Diffview, you get **3 areas:**

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ                 ‚îÇ                 ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   File Panel    ‚îÇ   Diff Panel    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   (left side)   ‚îÇ  (side-by-side) ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                 ‚îÇ                 ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  file1.lua      ‚îÇ  OLD  ‚îÇ  NEW   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  file2.lua      ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  file3.lua      ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Key insight:** 
- **File Panel** = List of changed files (like Neogit)
- **Diff Panel** = The actual code comparison

---

## Step 4: Navigate Between Files

You have multiple files changed - let's jump between them:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<Tab>` | Jump to **file panel** |
| `<Enter>` | Open file under cursor |
| `]c` | Next change in **current file** |
| `[c` | Previous change in **current file** |
| `]D` | Next **file** |
| `[D` | Previous **file** |

**Exercise:**
1. Make changes to 3 files
2. Open Diffview: `<Space>dd`
3. Press `<Tab>` to focus file panel (left)
4. Navigate with `j` / `k`
5. Press `<Enter>` on a file to see its diff
6. Press `]D` to jump to next file
7. Press `[D` to go back

**Pro tip:** You can also use `/` to search in the file panel!

---

## Step 5: Navigate Within Diffs (Jump to Changes)

Within a file, jump between actual code changes:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `]c` | Jump to **next change** (hunk) |
| `[c` | Jump to **previous change** (hunk) |

**Exercise:**
1. Open a file with 3+ changes
2. Open Diffview: `<Space>dd`
3. Press `]c` repeatedly - cursor jumps to each change
4. Press `[c` to go backwards

**This is huge:** You can quickly scan all changes without reading unchanged code!

---

## Step 6: Stage/Unstage from Diffview

You can stage directly from the diff view:

**In the file panel:**
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | Stage file under cursor |
| `u` | Unstage file under cursor |
| `S` | Stage all |
| `U` | Unstage all |

**Exercise:**
1. Open Diffview with changes: `<Space>dd`
2. Press `<Tab>` to focus file panel
3. Navigate to a file: `j`
4. Press `s` - it stages
5. Notice the icon changes (staged vs unstaged)

---

## Step 7: Compare Branches (The Power Move)

This is where Diffview shines - comparing your branch against main:

**Command:**
```vim
:DiffviewOpen main
```

This shows **ALL differences** between your current branch and `main`.

**Exercise:**
1. Make sure you're on a feature branch
2. Make some commits
3. Run: `:DiffviewOpen main`
4. You'll see every file that differs from main
5. Navigate through them with `<Tab>` + `<Enter>` + `]D`

**Use cases:**
- Review your branch before creating PR
- See what changed in main while you were working
- Compare any two branches: `:DiffviewOpen branch1..branch2`

---

## Step 8: Review a Commit (Time Travel)

See what changed in a specific commit:

**Command:**
```vim
:DiffviewOpen HEAD~1
```

This shows the **last commit's changes**.

**More examples:**
- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~2` - 2 commits ago
- `:DiffviewOpen abc123` - Specific commit hash
- `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~3..HEAD` - Last 3 commits combined

**Exercise:**
1. Run: `:DiffviewOpen HEAD~1`
2. Review what you changed in your last commit
3. Close: `:DiffviewClose`

**Use case:** "What did I change yesterday?" or "What does this commit do?"

---

## Step 9: File History (See How a File Evolved)

See all changes to a specific file over time:

**Command:**
```vim
:DiffviewFileHistory %
```

The `%` means "current file".

**Exercise:**
1. Open any file that has history: `:e lua/config/keymaps.lua`
2. Run: `:DiffviewFileHistory %`
3. You'll see a list of **all commits** that touched this file
4. Press `<Enter>` on a commit to see its diff
5. Navigate commits with `j` / `k`

**Specific file:**
```vim
:DiffviewFileHistory lua/config/keymaps.lua
```

---

## Step 10: File History for Visual Selection (Blame on Steroids)

See history of **specific lines** only:

**Exercise:**
1. Open a file
2. Enter visual mode: `V`
3. Select some lines: `jjj`
4. Run: `:'<,'>DiffviewFileHistory`
5. See only commits that changed **those specific lines**!

**This is incredible for:** "Who changed this function and why?"

---

## Step 11: Close Diffview (Multiple Ways)

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:DiffviewClose` | Close Diffview |
| `:tabclose` | Close current tab (Diffview uses tabs) |
| `ZZ` | In file panel, closes Diffview |

**Pro tip:** Diffview opens in a new tab, so you can switch between it and your code with `:tabn` / `:tabp` or `gt` / `gT`.

---

## Step 12: Merge Conflict Resolution (The Killer Feature)

When you have merge conflicts, Diffview makes it **visual and easy**.

**Setup a conflict (for practice):**
1. Create a conflict (we can do this if you want)
2. Open Diffview: `<Space>dd`
3. You'll see a **3-way merge view:**
   ```
   OURS  ‚îÇ  BASE  ‚îÇ  THEIRS
   ```

**Conflict resolution keys:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `co` | Choose **OURS** (your changes) |
| `ct` | Choose **THEIRS** (their changes) |
| `cb` | Choose **BASE** (original) |
| `ca` | Choose **ALL** (both changes) |

**Exercise (we'll do this later when you have a conflict):**
1. Navigate to conflict with `]c`
2. Press `co` to choose your version
3. Or press `ct` to choose their version
4. Save the file: `:w`
5. Stage it in Neogit: `<Space>gn` ‚Üí `s`
6. Commit: `cc`

**This alone saves hours of manual conflict editing!**

---

## Step 13: Combine with Neogit (The Ultimate Workflow)

Here's how Diffview + Neogit work together:

**Scenario: Review branch before PR**

1. **Get the big picture:**
   ```vim
   :DiffviewOpen main
   ```
   See all changes at once

2. **Review file by file:**
   ```
   <Tab>           ‚Üí File panel
   j j j           ‚Üí Navigate files
   <Enter>         ‚Üí View diff
   ]c              ‚Üí Jump through changes
   ]D              ‚Üí Next file
   ```

3. **Stage good changes:**
   ```
   <Tab>           ‚Üí Back to file panel
   s               ‚Üí Stage reviewed files
   ```

4. **Close Diffview and commit:**
   ```
   :DiffviewClose
   <Space>gn       ‚Üí Open Neogit
   cc              ‚Üí Commit staged files
   ```

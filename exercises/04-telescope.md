# Telescope Step-by-Step Guide

Complete guide to mastering Telescope for finding files, searching code, and navigating your project.

---

## Step 1: Understanding Telescope

Telescope is your **fuzzy finder** - it helps you find anything in your project instantly.

**What can Telescope find?**
- Files
- Text in files (grep)
- Open buffers
- Git files and commits
- Help documentation
- Commands and keymaps
- And much more!

**Key feature:** As you type, results filter in **real-time**.

---

## Step 2: Find Files (Most Common Use)

The most-used Telescope command:

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>ff` (find files)
2. Telescope picker opens
3. Start typing a filename
4. Press `<Enter>` to open the file

**Try these:**
```
<Space>ff       â†’ Type "init"     â†’ Opens init.lua
<Space>ff       â†’ Type "readme"   â†’ Opens README.md
<Space>ff       â†’ Type "git"      â†’ Shows all files with "git" in name
```

**Pro tip:** You don't need to type the exact name - "keymap" will find "keymaps.lua"!

## Step 3: Telescope Navigation Keys

Inside any Telescope picker:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<C-j>` | Move selection **down** |
| `<C-k>` | Move selection **up** |
| `<C-n>` | Next item (alternative) |
| `<C-p>` | Previous item (alternative) |
| `<Enter>` | Open selected file |
| `<C-x>` | Open in **horizontal split** |
| `<C-v>` | Open in **vertical split** |
| `<C-t>` | Open in new **tab** |
| `<C-q>` | Send to **quickfix list** |
| `<Esc>` or `<C-c>` | Close Telescope |

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>ff`
2. Type to filter
3. Use `<C-j>` and `<C-k>` to navigate
4. Press `<C-v>` to open in vertical split

---

## Step 4: Live Grep (Search Text in Files)

Find text across your entire project:

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>fg` (find grep / live grep)
2. Type any text (e.g., "function")
3. See all occurrences across all files
4. Navigate with `<C-j>` / `<C-k>`
5. Press `<Enter>` to jump to that line

**Try searching for:**
```
<Space>fg       â†’ Type "require"  â†’ Find all imports
<Space>fg       â†’ Type "TODO"     â†’ Find all TODOs
<Space>fg       â†’ Type "keymap"   â†’ Find keymap definitions
```

**This is incredibly powerful** - faster than manual searching!

---

## Step 5: Search Current Buffer (File You're In)

Search within the file you're currently editing:

**Exercise:**
1. Open a large file (e.g., `init.lua`)
2. Press `<Space>f/` (find in current buffer)
3. Type text to find
4. Jump directly to matches

**Use case:** "Where is that function in this file?"

---

## Step 6: Find Buffers (Open Files)

Switch between files you already have open:

**Exercise:**
1. Open 3-4 files
2. Press `<Space>fb` (find buffers)
3. See list of all open files
4. Type to filter
5. Press `<Enter>` to switch

**This is faster than:**
- `:ls` then `:b <number>`
- Clicking through tabs
- `:bnext` / `:bprev`

---

## Step 7: Recent Files (Oldfiles)

Access recently opened files:

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>fr` (find recent)
2. See your file history
3. Type to filter
4. Open any recent file instantly

**Use case:** "What was I working on yesterday?"

---

## Step 8: Help Tags (Search Documentation)

Never leave Neovim to search help:

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>fh` (find help)
2. Type "split" to find help on splits
3. Press `<Enter>` to open help doc
4. Try searching: "window", "buffer", "register"

**This is your built-in manual** - incredibly useful!

---

## Step 9: Search Word Under Cursor

Find all occurrences of the current word:

**Exercise:**
1. Put cursor on any word/function name
2. Press `<Space>fw` (find word)
3. See all occurrences across project
4. Jump to any occurrence

**Use case:** "Where is this function used?"

---

## Step 10: Commands (Find Available Commands)

See all available Neovim commands:

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>fc` (find commands)
2. Type "Diff" to see all diff commands
3. Type "Telescope" to see all Telescope commands
4. Press `<Enter>` to run a command

**Discovery tool** - great for learning new features!

---

## Step 11: Keymaps (Find Your Keybindings)

Forgot a keymap? Search for it!

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>fk` (find keymaps)
2. Type "git" to see all git keymaps
3. Type "telescope" to see telescope keymaps
4. Type "space" to see leader keymaps

**Never forget a keymap again!**

---

## Step 12: Git Integration (Files)

Find Git-tracked files only:

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>tf` (telescope git files)
2. See only files tracked by git
3. Faster than `<Space>ff` in large projects

**Also try:**
```
<Space>ts       â†’ Git status (changed files)
<Space>tb       â†’ Git branches (switch branches)
<Space>tgc      â†’ Git commits (browse history)
```

---

## Step 13: Git Branches (Quick Switch)

Switch branches instantly:

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>tb` (telescope branches)
2. See all branches
3. Type to filter
4. Press `<Enter>` to checkout

**Faster than:** `git branch` + `git checkout`

---

## Step 14: Diagnostics (Errors & Warnings)

Browse all LSP errors/warnings:

**Exercise:**
1. If you have any errors in project
2. Press `<Space>fd` (find diagnostics)
3. See all errors listed
4. Jump to any error with `<Enter>`

**Use case:** "Show me all errors in project"

---

## Step 15: Treesitter (Navigate Functions/Classes)

Jump to functions and classes in current file:

**Exercise:**
1. Open a large file with functions
2. Press `<Space>ft` (find treesitter)
3. See all functions/classes/methods
4. Type to filter
5. Jump to any function

**Use case:** "Jump to the setup() function"

---

## Step 16: Resume Last Search

Reopen your last Telescope search:

**Exercise:**
1. Do any Telescope search
2. Close it with `<Esc>`
3. Press `<Space>f.` (resume)
4. Your last search reopens!

**Use case:** "I closed that search by mistake!"

---

## Step 17: Quickfix List

Send multiple results to quickfix:

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>fg` and search for "function"
2. Mark multiple items with `<Tab>` (or `<S-Tab>` to unmark)
3. Press `<C-q>` to send to quickfix
4. Navigate quickfix with `:cnext` / `:cprev`

**Or open quickfix picker:**
```
<Space>fq       â†’ Browse quickfix list in Telescope
```

---

## Step 18: Spell Suggestions

Get spelling suggestions for word under cursor:

**Exercise:**
1. Type a misspelled word: "teh"
2. Put cursor on it
3. Press `<Space>fs` (find spell)
4. See suggestions
5. Press `<Enter>` to replace

---

## Step 19: Vim Options

Search and change Vim settings:

**Exercise:**
1. Press `<Space>fo` (find options)
2. Type "number" to find number-related settings
3. Type "wrap" to find line wrapping
4. Press `<Enter>` to toggle/change

**Discovery tool** - see all available options!

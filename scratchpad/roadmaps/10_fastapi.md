# Flask API Learning Plan

A structured, phase-by-phase guide to building RESTful APIs using Flask. Ideal for Python developers who want a lightweight, flexible framework to create fast and maintainable web services.

---

## Resources

- [Flask Official Docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Miguel Grinberg‚Äôs Flask API Guide](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask)
- [Flask-RESTful Extension](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for API testing

---

## Tips for Success

- Focus on modular structure from the start.
- Use Postman or curl to test endpoints manually.
- Document your API clearly using Swagger or Postman collections.
- Use #FlaskAPI, #PythonBackend, and #RESTfulAPI when posting on LinkedIn or GitHub.

  - Using Blueprints for modular APIs
  - Environment configs (`.env`)
- **Projects:**
  - Modular blog API with Blueprints
  - Admin/User route separation
  - Config-based app with separate dev/prod environments
- **Suggested LinkedIn Post:**
  "Refactored my Flask API into Blueprints for better structure ‚Äî clean, modular, and ready for scale!"

---

- **Topics:**
  - Token-based Auth (JWT)
  - Password hashing (bcrypt)
  - Auth middleware
- **Projects:**
  - JWT login/register API

  "Implemented JWT auth in my Flask API ‚Äî secure endpoints and role-based access are working! üîê"

---

### Phase 7: Testing & Documentation (Week 8)
- **Topics:**
  - Unit testing with `unittest` or `pytest`
  - Auto docs (Flasgger, Postman, Swagger UI)
  - Error handling and logging
- **Projects:**
  - Write tests for all endpoints
  - Swagger-based documentation
  - Custom error messages and logs
- **Suggested LinkedIn Post:**
  "Wrote tests for my Flask API and added Swagger docs ‚Äî now my app is fully testable and documented ‚úÖüìö"

---

### Phase 8: Deployment & Capstone
- **Topics:**
  - Hosting with Render/Fly.io/VPS
  - WSGI server (Gunicorn)
  - Environment management & `.env`
- **Capstone Ideas:**
  - Blog API with auth and roles
